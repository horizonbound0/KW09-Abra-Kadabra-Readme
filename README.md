# Abra Kadabra README ![License badge image](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue)

## Description

Creating a professional, quality README is important to any project, and doing it by hand over and over again is a recipe for inviting mistakes! I want a simple program that can take user input and create a README for me to help keep errors down, and professionalism and quality up. 

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

To install the project, make sure to save all the necessary files in one location. Separating any of the files may break the program. 

## Usage

To use the program first open a terminal from the root directory of the program. Then make sure NPM is installed by typing 'npm install' in the terminal. After it's installed, type 'node index.js' and follow the prompts. Once you've answered all the prompts, an 'exampleREADME.md' is created in the root directory. At this point you can move the 'exampleREADME.md' to the project folder you made it for and rename it to simply 'README.md'. It's what I did for this project!
